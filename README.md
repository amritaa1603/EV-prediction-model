# EV-prediction-model
# Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) across various counties. Using publicly available data and Python-based tools, the notebook provides insights into EV population growth patterns and builds a simple model to predict future adoption. The project is intended for academic and analytical exploration of sustainability trends.
